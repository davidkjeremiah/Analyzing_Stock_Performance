We carried out three projects:
1. Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data
Objective: Here, we extracted the profit data for Tesla and GameStop and built a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the profit for the hedge fund.

2. Extracting Stock Data Using a Web Scraping
Objective: Here, we used beautiful soup to extract historical share data from a web-page.

3. Extracting Stock Data Using a Python Library
Objective: Here, we used the yfinance library to extract information about the stocks - returning data in a pandas dataframe.

4. Analysis plots or graphs are saved to the `Analyzing_Stock_Performance/figs/` directory
